# OutlookPilot - A productivity plugin for Outlook, inspired by [MailPilot|http://mindsense.co/mailpilot/] #

When I worked at [AWS|http://www.aws.com], I discovered [MailPilot|http://mindsense.co/mailpilot/] and quickly embraced its model of scheduling emails to be dealt with at some point in the future.  I especially like that the schedule is managed via a standard folder structure as opposed to a local metadata store as this allowed me to interact with the scheduling hierarchy using any mail client from any device.

Now that I'm working for [Azure|http://www.azure.com], having a Mac as my primary machine suddenly became less of an option.  Thus, OutlookPilot was born.

# FAQ #

1. Is OutlookPilot compatible with MailPilot such that I can use both on the same account?

In MVP, no.  I don't like MailPilot's folder naming as it doesn't follow digit significance and thus doesn't sort well.  If a bunch of people want to use OutlookPilot and MailPilot on the same account, I could probably be convinced to make it a configurable setting.
